## **Project Overview**

The **Hairdresser App** serves as a platform that bridges the gap between hairdressers and clients, allowing clients to book services, manage appointments, and leave feedback, while providing hairdressers with tools to organize their availability, handle appointments, and review client feedback.

The platform consists of two primary user types:

- **Clients**: Users who can book appointments and leave reviews.
- **Hairdressers**: Professionals who provide services and manage client appointments.

The app includes a user-friendly interface, appointment scheduling through a calendar, and an integrated review system to enhance user experience on both ends.

## **Application Structure**

The project is organized into the following Django apps:

1. **hairdressers/**: Manages hairdresser profiles, schedules, and reviews.
2. **clients/**: Handles client profiles and appointment bookings.
3. **appointments/**: Manages the creation, modification, and deletion of appointments.
4. **reviews/**: Manages the review system, allowing clients to leave feedback for hairdressers.

The main directories and files are:

- `manage.py`: The command-line utility for running the project.
- `settings.py`: Contains configuration settings, including the database, static files, and installed applications.
- `urls.py`: The root URL configuration file, routing all incoming requests to the appropriate views.

## **Database Models**

The application uses PostgreSQL to store data, and Django ORM manages the interactions. Key models are:

1. **User Model**: Handles user authentication, linked to the `Client` and `Hairdresser` models.
2. **Hairdresser Model**:
   - Linked to the `User` model via a `ForeignKey`.
   - Stores specialization, experience, and availability.
3. **Client Model**:
   - Linked to the `User` model via a `ForeignKey`.
   - Represents users who book appointments.
4. **Appointment Model**:
   - Links `Client` and `Hairdresser`.
   - Contains appointment details like service, date, time, and duration.
5. **Review Model**:
   - Links `Client` and `Hairdresser`.
   - Stores reviews and ratings (1-5 stars).
